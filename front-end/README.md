# Doctorlink Front End Task

## Scenario

Taking the API you have built for the .net task, we want to be able to see your ability to follow wireframes to build a front end that will display the notifications in a way that follows good UX.

## Getting set up

Before building, run `npm i` to install necessary packages.

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Tech test requirements

Following the wireframes provided, please expand on this front end project to build pages and components to display notifications.

[http://tinyimg.io/i/Ix6RiwU.png](http://tinyimg.io/i/Ix6RiwU.png) Notifications
You will find image assets in the public/images folder.

Please do the best you can to make the UI look like the wireframe images, but don't worry if your pixel measurements etc aren't perfect. We just want to see what you can do in the time you have.
This is for a desktop view.

### Pages

Homepage: A simple page to welcome the user
Notifications page: The page to display notifications.

### Components

Navigation sidebar: Allows user to move from one page to the next
Notifications: Clicking on a notification will display a modal that shows the full message of the notification. The modal should close from a button on the modal.

### Nice - to - haves

We're aware your time is limited and just want you to do the best you can in the time you have.
The following are not essential criteria, but would be great to see you demonstrate if you can:

- Any kind of tests
- Attention to UX (feel free to improve on our designs if you think of a better way to display things)
- Linting
- CSS pre-processors or styled-components
- Any extra features/design elements you think would add to the application (be as creative as you want to be)
- Any improvements to the architecture of the app
- Mobile/responsive view of UI

### Languages

This starter app we have given you is built in React, however, please feel free to use any language you're comfortable with if you'd rather build something from scratch. You're welcome to use a boilerplate or package similar to `create-react-app` to get started.
